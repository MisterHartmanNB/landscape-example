# landscape-generator
Landscape generator project following the learning of control structures in javascript, using project 6.2 from codehs.com.
From the class "Video Game Design with JavaScript"

In this challenge, you will make a landscape generator. If you think about it, creating a landscape requires a lot of repetition. If you want to make a forest, you have to draw a lot of trees. Or if you want to draw the night sky, you have to draw a lot of stars. Luckily, we can write computer programs that draw multiple objects at once!

**Requirements**

Your landscape generator must include the following:

User input to determine at least one aspect of the image. For example, you can ask the user if they want it to be daytime or nighttime.
A loop that draws at least one aspect of the image. This can be a for loop or a while loop, whichever makes the most sense in your program.

**Tips**

A few things to consider while youâ€™re programming:

The order in which you draw objects on the canvas matters. Think carefully about which object you draw first and which object you draw last.
To vary the types of images in your landscape, consider importing images to your program to create WebImage objects rather than using Rectangle and Circle graphics objects. You can also draw your own vector images by going to this vector editor!
